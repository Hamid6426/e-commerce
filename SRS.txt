6. Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)

6.1 Level 1 - User Interaction
User requests data from the frontend.
Frontend communicates with backend APIs for user, product, cart, and order operations.

6.2 Level 2 - Product Catalog
Vendors upload products, which are stored in the product service.
Products are indexed for search functionality.

6.3 Level 3 - Payment Processing
User initiates payment; request goes to payment service.
Payment service communicates with third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe).
Confirmation sent to user and order service for status update.

7. User Interface Mockups (Optional)

8. Constraints
The platform must comply with GDPR for user data protection.
Payment transactions must adhere to PCI DSS standards.

9. Assumptions and Dependencies
Assumes the availability of a high-speed internet connection for optimal experience.
